# Meeting 19.11.2018
## Summary of Project
TapGuard is a safety application that notifies emergency contacts during times of emergency. The MVC includes the ability to make calls on a tap of a button. Extensions include tracking the user and notifying emergency contacts if the user strays too far from the destination and a countdown timer that notifies emergency contacts if the user does not complete the journey in the indicated amount of time.
